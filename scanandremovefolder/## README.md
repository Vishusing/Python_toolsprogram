 ## README.md for Empty Folder Removal Script

### Overview
This script, `remove_empty_folders.py`, is designed to recursively remove empty folders within a specified folder bundle. It traverses the directory structure, identifying and deleting empty folders while providing feedback on the process.

### Prerequisites
Before using this script, ensure that you have the following:

- Python 3 or later installed on your system.
- The script file, `remove_empty_folders.py`, saved in a convenient location.

### Usage
To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `remove_empty_folders.py` script.
2. Execute the script by running the following command:

```
python remove_empty_folders.py
```

3. Specify the path to the folder bundle you want to scan for empty folders. Replace the placeholder text "path/to/your/folder/bundle" with the actual path to your folder bundle. For example:

```
python remove_empty_folders.py path/to/my/folder/bundle
```

### How it Works
The script employs a recursive algorithm to traverse the specified folder bundle and identify empty folders. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Importing the `os` Module**:
   ```python
   import os
   ```
   This line imports the Python `os` module, which provides functions for interacting with the operating system, including file and directory operations.

2. **Defining the `remove_empty_folders` Function**:
   ```python
   def remove_empty_folders(path):
   ```
   This function is the core of the script. It takes a single argument, `path`, which represents the path to the folder bundle that needs to be scanned.

3. **Recursive Traversal**:
   ```python
   for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path, topdown=False):
   ```
   This line initiates a recursive traversal of the specified folder bundle using the `os.walk()` function. It iterates through the root directory, subdirectories, and files within the bundle. The `topdown=False` argument ensures that the traversal starts from the bottom of the directory structure and moves upwards.

4. **Checking for Empty Folders**:
   ```python
   if not any(files) and not
