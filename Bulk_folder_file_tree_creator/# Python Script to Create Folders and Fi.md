 # Python Script to Create Folders and Files

This Python script creates a specified number of folders and files within a given base directory. It takes user input for the base directory path, the number of folders to be created, the number of files to be created in each folder, and the file extension.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. Importing the `os` Module

```python
import os
```

The `os` module provides functions for interacting with the operating system. It is used to create directories and files.

### 2. Getting User Input

The script prompts the user to enter the following information:

- **Base directory path:** The full path where the base directory should be created.
- **Number of folders:** The number of folders to be created within the base directory.
- **Number of files per folder:** The number of files to be created in each folder.
- **File extension:** The extension of the files to be created.

### 3. Creating the Base Directory

```python
# Create the base directory if it doesn't exist
if not os.path.exists(base_dir_path):
    os.makedirs(base_dir_path)
```

This code checks if the base directory already exists. If it doesn't, it creates the directory using the `os.makedirs()` function.

### 4. Extracting the Base Directory Name

```python
# Extract the base directory name from the path
base_dir_name = os.path.basename(base_dir_path)
```

This code extracts the name of the base directory from the full path. The `os.path.basename()` function returns the last component of a path.

### 5. Creating Folders

```python
# Create folders with numbered names within the base directory
for i in range(1, num_folders + 1):
    folder_name = f"folder_{i}"
    folder_path = os.path.join(base_dir_path, folder_name)
    os.makedirs(folder_path)
```

This code creates the specified number of folders within the base directory. Each folder is named `folder_1`, `folder_2`, and so on. The `os.path.join()` function is used to concatenate the base directory path and the folder name.

### 6. Creating Files

```python
# Create
